The resulting value will\n * always be between 0.0 and 1.0. The noise value can be animated by moving\n * through the noise space as demonstrated in the example above. The 2nd\n * and 3rd dimension can also be interpreted as time.<br /><br />The actual\n * noise is structured similar to an audio signal, in respect to the\n * function's use of frequencies. Similar to the concept of harmonics in\n * physics, perlin noise is computed over several octaves which are added\n * together for the final result. <br /><br />Another way to adjust the\n * character of the resulting sequence is the scale of the input\n * coordinates. As the function works within an infinite space the value of\n * the coordinates doesn't matter as such, only the distance between\n * successive coordinates does (eg. when using <b>noise()</b> within a\n * loop). As a general rule the smaller the difference between coordinates,\n * the smoother the resulting noise sequence will be.
